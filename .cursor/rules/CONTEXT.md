# Job Portal Project Vibe

## Goal

Build a Job Portal where users can register as a job seeker or a company. Priority is speed, simplicity, and modern, minimal UI.

## Vibe Definition

| Element   | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual    | Whitespace-heavy, rounded corners, pastel or soft accent colors. Feels clean and airy.                                       |
| UX        | Minimal friction. Avoid modal traps. Use sheet for any sub-page forms or information. Everything should feel one-click-away. |
| Tone      | Friendly, creator-focused, informal but clear. Encouraging and supportive.                                                   |
| Tech Feel | Fast, responsive, almost "magically light". Prefers SSR or statically streamed content. Smooth animations.                   |

## User Archetypes

### Job Seeker

- **Primary Goal**: Find and apply to relevant job opportunities quickly and effortlessly
- **Pain Points**:
  - Overwhelming application processes
  - Difficulty finding jobs that match their skills
  - Lack of feedback on applications

  - Difficulty standing out among competitors
  - Complex posting and management processes
  - Poor candidate communication tools
- **Behavior Patterns**:
  - Wants to post jobs quickly with minimal friction

  - Prefers automated alerts for critical issues
- **Success Metrics**:

## Rules and Constraints

### UX

- Keep flows linear and intuitive (not multi-modal)
- Embed delightful progression wherever possible (progress bars, completion dots, micro-animations)
- Use dialog for prompt and alert with smooth transitions
- Use toaster for info and error with subtle animations
- Use sheet for any additional info and form derived from page component
- Multi language support with seamless switching

### UI

- Tailwind + shadcn/ui with custom theme tokens
- Use Framer Motion for major component entries and micro-interactions
- Typography: `font-sans`, `text-sm` base, large `text-3xl` headers with proper spacing
- Icons via `lucide-react` with optional animations
- Tiptap Editor as rich text editor with custom styling

### Coding Patterns

- Use `app/` dir with server components for pages, client components for interactions
- For most pages, implement `page.tsx` as a server component to enable easy page metadata configuration and initial data fetching. Use client components for interactive elements and data-heavy operations that require client-side state management.
- For client components, use Tanstack Query for state management
- Put shared components in `components` folder
  - Put page specific components in `components/pages/[page-name]` folder
  - As the application and pages evolve, shared components may be moved between folders within `components` folder for better organization. Remember to update all import statements in the pages that use these components to avoid errors.
- Use PascalCase for Class name
- Use camelCase for function and variable name
- Use kebab-case for table and field name
- Keep code as modular and maintainable as possible
- Decouple frontend from backend implementation
  - Create client-side API layer as functions and let these functions handle the API calls
  - Frontend must call these functions, not the API endpoints directly
- Convert database schema into TypeScript types and store them in `packages/shared/types` folder
  - Use these types as the single source of truth for all type definitions
  - Extend, pick, omit, or make partial from existing types rather than creating new ones
- For Tanstack Query usage, organize queries by category in dedicated files within a specific folder structure for better maintainability and organization

### Key Organizational Principles

- **Route Groups**: Use Next.js route groups `(auth)`, `(website)` to organize related pages without affecting URL structure
- **Role-Based Structure**: Separate app directories for different user roles (`company/`, `jobseeker/`)
- **Component Hierarchy**: Organize components from generic (`ui/`) to specific (`pages/`) to shared (`shared/`)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a clear, single responsibility
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common utilities and types are centralized in the `shared` package
- **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new packages (mobile app, admin dashboard, etc.) in the future
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions across all packages
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each package can be developed and tested independently
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types are shared and consistently used across packages

## ðŸ”§ Development Commands

- `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `yarn db:generate` - Generate database migrations
- `yarn db:migrate` - Apply database migrations
- `yarn db:seed` - Seed database with sample data
- `yarn build` - Build for production

### Auth.js Development

- **Environment Setup**: Create `.env.local` with NextAuth configuration
- **Database Migrations**: Run after schema changes for Auth.js compatibility
- **Session Testing**: Use browser dev tools to inspect NextAuth sessions
- **Protected Routes**: Test role-based access control in development
