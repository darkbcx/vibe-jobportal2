## 🔍 How to Use These Specs

### When Implementing Features
1. **Start with feature specs** - Read `.cursor/rules/specs-features/[feature-name].md`
2. **Check page specs** - See how the feature fits into page layouts in `.cursor/rules/specs-pages/`
3. **Review component specs** - Understand the UI component requirements in `.cursor/rules/specs-components/`
4. **Cross-reference with CONTEXT.md** - Ensure alignment with project structure

### When Creating Components
1. **Read the specific component spec** - Get detailed requirements from `.cursor/rules/specs-components/[component-name].md`
2. **Check related feature specs** - Understand the business logic from `.cursor/rules/specs-features/`
3. **Review UI/UX guidelines** - Follow design principles from `ui-ux-guidelines.mdc`
4. **Verify folder structure** - Place in correct location per `project-context.mdc`

### When Building Pages
1. **Start with page spec** - Understand layout and content requirements from `.cursor/rules/specs-pages/[page-name].md`
2. **Check component specs** - See what components are needed from `.cursor/rules/specs-components/`
3. **Review feature specs** - Understand the functionality from `.cursor/rules/specs-features/`
4. **Follow routing structure** - Use correct Next.js patterns per `coding-standards.mdc`

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### Before Starting Development
- [ ] Read relevant feature specification
